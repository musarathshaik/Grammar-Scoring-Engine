# 🎙️ Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice Samples

## 📌 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a model that evaluates the grammatical quality of spoken English using voice samples. The system converts speech to text, analyzes the grammar of the transcribed text, and outputs a **continuous grammar score** ranging from **0 to 5**.

## 📂 Dataset Structure

Your dataset should include:

### `train.csv`
```csv

filename,label
sample1.wav,4.5
sample2.wav,2.0
filename: Name of the audio file (must be in the audio/ folder)

label: Ground truth grammar score (0–5)

audio/
Folder containing .wav voice samples.

🧪 Project Pipeline
1. Speech-to-Text
Uses Whisper or SpeechRecognition to transcribe .wav audio files into English text.

2. Grammar Analysis
Transcribed text is processed using language_tool_python to detect grammar mistakes.

3. Feature Engineering
Extract grammar-related features:

Total number of errors

Grammar error density (errors per word/sentence)

Sentence complexity, etc.

4. Scoring Model
A regression model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) predicts grammar scores based on extracted features.

🧰 Dependencies
Install all required packages via:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Key Libraries:

whisper or SpeechRecognition

language_tool_python

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

🚀 Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Transcribe audio
python transcribe.py

# 2. Extract grammar features
python extract_features.py

# 3. Train & evaluate the grammar scoring model
python train_model.py
📊 Output
The model predicts a grammar score (0–5) for each sample. You can visualize prediction performance with scatter plots, MAE, or RMSE.

🧠 Future Improvements
Improve transcription accuracy using fine-tuned ASR models.

Include fluency and prosody-based features.

Try deep learning models (e.g., BERT for text embedding + regression).
